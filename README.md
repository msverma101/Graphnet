## Graphnet

A graph (is a pair G = (V, E), where V is a set whose elements are called vertices 
 and E is a set of paired vertices, whose elements are called edges 

Translating a graph into features of neural network
1. Adjacency matrix
2. Node attribute matrix – features – point correspondences 
3. Edge attribute matrix – just one  -
4. possible to give higher values to edges where more folds occur
